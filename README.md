Project done for Introduction to Cybersecurity(CS366) class at University of Tennessee.

This implements a web app that looks like a GMail login form, but all it does is store the user credentials to firebase server and forwards the user to the real site. It is as an exercise to learn how phising works and is not deployed anywhere or used to trick real users.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
